# Generic Atom Diagram - Project Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the planned future development for the "Generic Atom Diagram with Quantum Orbitals" project. It's a living document, and community input is highly encouraged!

## Current Status
The project currently provides a functional 2D visualization of atomic structure, including electron shells, subshells, and interactive quantum transitions based on embedded energy data. Core functionalities like dynamic atom generation, zoom/pan, and detailed hover/click information are implemented.

## Future Goals
Our vision is to evolve this into a comprehensive and highly interactive educational tool. The development is planned in phases:


2D visualization. Orbitals and energies, add different notations and how do they relate to each other. 


3D: add model progression (progression in accuracy): so for example first model is bohr and last is Dirac-Fock, then add the intermediate models. 

Models: Bohr (1913) → Schrödinger (1926) → Hartree-Fock (1930s) → Dirac-Fock (1930s) → QED/MCDF (1950s & beyond)
For each model explain what theory and assumptions is using, what can explain and maybe its limits. 

A big part of the collaboration will be on setting the equations, computing the wave functions, obtain the 3D orbitals shape and then upload this computed 
parts to the repo. 


### Phase 1: 3D Visualization Core (Short-term)
Goal: Transition the core atom visualization from 2D to a basic 3D model, enabling fundamental 3D interaction.

Implement 3D Rendering Engine:

Integrate Three.js (or a suitable alternative) for 3D rendering capabilities.

Set up a basic 3D scene, camera, and renderer.

Basic 3D Atom Model:

Represent the nucleus as a central 3D sphere.

Visualize electron shells as concentric 3D rings or transparent spheres.

Place electrons as simple 3D points or small spheres on their respective shells.

Interactive 3D Camera Controls:

Enable mouse-based rotation (orbit controls) around the atom.

Implement 3D zooming and panning.

Initial Responsiveness for 3D: Ensure the 3D canvas resizes correctly with the window.

### Phase 2: Advanced Quantum Visualizations (Mid-term)
Goal: Introduce more accurate and detailed quantum mechanical representations in 3D.

Visualize Quantum Orbital Shapes:

Render s, p, d, and f orbital shapes (e.g., spherical for s, dumbbell for p, cloverleaf for d) using 3D meshes.

Allow toggling between Bohr shell view and quantum orbital view.

Electron Density Clouds: Instead of discrete electrons, visualize electron probability distributions as volumetric clouds or particle systems within orbitals.

Interactive Quantum Numbers Display:

Dynamically display the principal (n), azimuthal (l), magnetic (m 
l
​
 ), and spin (m 
s
​
 ) quantum numbers for selected electrons or orbitals.

Highlight orbitals based on quantum number selection.

Electron Spin Visualization: Represent electron spin (up/down) visually.

Orbital Hybridization (Conceptual): Provide a conceptual visualization of orbital hybridization (e.g., sp3, sp2, sp) for simple molecules (beyond a single atom).

### Phase 3: Interactive Simulations & Data (Long-term)
Goal: Add dynamic simulations and integrate with external, real-world atomic data.

Animated Electron Transitions:

Animate electrons moving between orbitals during emission and absorption events.

Visually represent photons being absorbed or emitted (e.g., as small light particles).

User-Controlled Electron Excitation:

Allow users to "click and drag" an electron to a higher energy orbital (simulating absorption).

Implement a mechanism for excited electrons to "decay" back to lower states, emitting photons.

External Data Integration:

Connect to external atomic databases (e.g., NIST Atomic Spectra Database) to fetch more accurate and comprehensive energy levels, transition probabilities, and spectral data.

Implement a robust error handling and fallback mechanism for API calls.

Isotopes and Ions Support: Allow users to specify neutron count for isotopes and electron count for ions, dynamically adjusting the diagram.

### Phase 4: Educational Enhancements (Future)
Goal: Transform the visualization into a comprehensive learning platform.

Integrated Mini-Lessons: Embed concise explanations and tutorials directly into the interface, contextual to the displayed atomic features.

Interactive Quizzes/Challenges: Develop small quizzes or challenges to test user understanding of atomic concepts.

Multi-Language Support: Implement internationalization (i18n) to support multiple languages.

Save/Share State: Allow users to save their current atom configuration or share a link to a specific visualization.
